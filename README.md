### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I have already done this challenge before and wanted to try it out again since Frontend Mentor just released a new feature called "Learning Paths", which is a series of challenges that will help you improve your coding skills. I have not been doing lots of challenges recently because I was focused on studying more on JavaScript at The Odin Project and watching tutorials on YouTube. Nevertheless I had fun with this challenge and hope to still get some criticism and feedback from you guys. Thank you and have a nice day!
