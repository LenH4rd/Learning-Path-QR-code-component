## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I always forget how to implement the new way fonts are imported in CSS. I had to look it up again and it is pretty simple.

here is the code:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/static/Outfit-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 400;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/static/Outfit-Bold.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

I have already done this challenge before and wanted to try it out again since Frontend Mentor just released a new feature called "Learning Paths", which is a series of challenges that will help you improve your coding skills. I have not been doing lots of challenges recently because I was focused on studying more on JavaScript at The Odin Project and watching tutorials on YouTube. Nevertheless I had fun with this challenge and hope to still get some criticism and feedback from you guys. Thank you and have a nice day!
